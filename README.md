This is a project that demonstrates cryptographic functionalities in Java. It should **NEVER** be used in production environments as it might contain some security issues. This is to be used for **education** and **demonstration** purposes only.

Parts of this code depends of the [BouncyCastle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/) cryptographic library, so you should install it to use the code.
